### Description:
   In this project, I have implemented RESTful endpoints to manage a book library.

### How To Run Project:
        - Clone this repository to your local machine.
        - Wait a few minutes for all dependencies to install.
        - Create a database in MySQL, then paste the database name in the application.properties file. You can choose any name.
        - change database user name or password
        - Run the application

### Here are the APIs you can test using Swagger or Postman:

### For ease of testing, I have created the endpoint and JSON for all entities. Here is the link to it.
